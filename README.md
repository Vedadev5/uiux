# UI/UX App 

## 📌 Task Overview
This project is  specifically focused on Designing and Implementing UI/UX. The goal was to design and implement a visually appealing and responsive Android application interface using **Figma** for UI planning and **Android Studio with Java** for implementation.

---

## 🎯 Objective
> Create and implement a user interface and user experience design that follows best practices and results in an engaging mobile app.

---

## 🗓️ Timeline
**Phases:**
1. Design Preparation  
2. Implement UI Components  
3. Integrate Design

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Figma** – for creating wireframes and mockups
- **Text-to-Design AI Plugin (Figma)** – for structured layout generation
- **Android Studio** – for app development
- **Java** – for backend logic and event handling
- **XML** – for UI layout
- **Drawable resources** – for rounded corners and background styling

## 🎨 UI/UX Design with Figma

I started by creating a clean and professional wireframe in **Figma**, targeting mobile screen dimensions (1280x720).  
The layout included:

- A centered card container
- Title: "Welcome to UI/UX App"
- Two rounded input fields for name and email
- A colorful gradient **Submit** button
- A text view to display a greeting based on input

This mockup helped in visualizing the final layout before moving to Android Studio.

## 🔄 Converting Figma to Android Layout

Based on the Figma mockup, I created the app UI in Android Studio using XML and Java:

### 📁 Files Created:
- `activity_main.xml` – Layout with EditTexts, Button, and TextView
- `MainActivity.java` – Java code to handle input and display output
- `res/drawable/rounded_edittext.xml` – Custom background for rounded EditTexts
- `res/drawable/rounded_button.xml` – Custom drawable for gradient button
- `themes.xml` – Styling adjustments for colors and fonts

## 🧩 Key Features Implemented

### ✅ UI Components:
- EditText with hint, padding, rounded corners
- Submit Button with gradient background and ripple effect
- TextView to display personalized greeting
- Colorful linear gradient background

### 🎨 Styles & Themes:
- Custom XML drawable for inputs and buttons
- Gradient backgrounds (LinearGradient in XML)
- Defined colors and text styles in theme files

### 📱 Responsive Layout:
- Used `ConstraintLayout` for adaptive positioning
- `dp/sp` units for scaling across devices
- Ensured proper layout rendering in both portrait and tablet modes
